# Warhammer 9th Age Battlescribe Files

These are the files to use with battlescribe to create armies for "9th Age".

Please click "Download ZIP" to the right to download the package. This is intended mainly for development.

**If you are looking for datafiles to use rather than develop, links to a much more userfriendly package can be found here:** http://warhammer.org.uk/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=98&t=130359

If you run into a bug, please inform me at "jimmy.eliasson@hotmail.se", or in this thread: http://warhammer.org.uk/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=98&t=130359

If you need help on how to import the files, a guide can be found here: http://www.battlescribe.net/help-overview.html
